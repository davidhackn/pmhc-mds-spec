  ‘Usual’ is defined as where the person usually resides for four or more days per week on average. If it is

  resided in during the reference week is reported.

  CODE 1:  Private residence (e.g. private or public rental, owned, purchasing etc)

           group homes, cluster apartments where a support worker lives on site, community residential apartments,

           types 1.01, 1.02 or 1.03 should be coded to 4). Supported accommodation facilities include hostels for 
           people with disability. This code should be used for larger supported accommodation facilities 
           (usually 7 or more people) that provide 24 hour supervision or care. Smaller supported accommodation 
           facilities (i.e. less than 7 people) which may or may not have 24 hour supervision or care should be

  The co-payment is the amount paid by the client per session, not the fee paid by the project to  
  the provider or the fee paid by the project to the provider plus the client contribution. In many cases, 
  there will not be a co-payment charged and therefore zero should be entered. Where a co-payment is charged 
  it should be minimal and based on an individual's capacity to pay.
