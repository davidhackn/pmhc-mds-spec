Comments: |-
  Describes the main focus of the services to be delivered to the client for the
  current episode of care, selected from a defined list of categories.

  Service providers are required to report on the 'Principal focus of treatment
  plan' for all accepted referrals. This requires a judgement to be made about
  the main focus of the services to be delivered to the client for the current
  episode of care, made following initial assessment and modifiable at a later
  stage. It is chosen from a defined list of categories, with the provider
  required to select the category that best fits the treatment plan designed
  for the client.

  Principal focus of treatment plan is necessarily a judgement made by the
  provider at the outset of service delivery but consistent with good practice,
  should be made on the basis of a treatment plan developed in collaboration
  with the client.

  1 - Psychological therapy
    The treatment plan for the client is primarily based around the delivery of
    psychological therapy by one or more mental health professionals. This
    category most closely matches the type of services delivered under the
    previous ATAPS program where up to 12 individual treatment sessions, and 18
    in exceptional circumstances, could be provided. These sessions could be
    supplemented by up to 10 group-based sessions.

    The concept of 'mental health professionals' has a specific meaning defined
    invthe various guidance documentation prepared to support PHNs in
    implementation of reforms. It refers to service providers who do not meet
    the requirements for registration, credentialing or recognition as a
    qualified mental health professional and includes:

     - Psychiatrists
     - Registered Psychologists
     - Clinical Psychologists
     - Mental Health Nurses;
     - Occupational Therapists;
     - Social Workers
     - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health workers.

  2 - Low intensity psychological intervention
    The treatment plan for the client is primarily based around delivery of
    time-limited, structured psychological interventions that are aimed at
    providing a less costly intervention alternative to 'standard'
    psychological therapy. The essence of low intensity interventions is that
    they utilise nil or relatively little qualified mental health professional
    time and are targeted at people with, or at risk of, mild mental illness.
    Low intensity episodes can be delivered through a range of mechanisms
    including use of individuals with appropriate competencies but who do not
    meet the requirements for registration, credentialing or recognition as a
    mental health professional; delivery of services principally through
    group-based programs; and delivery of brief or low cost forms of treatment
    by mental health professionals.

  3 - Clinical care coordination
     The treatment plan for the client is primarily based around delivery of
     a range of services where the overarching aim is to coordinate and better
     integrate care for the individual across multiple providers. Clinical care
     coordination and liaison activities account for a significant proportion
     of service contacts delivered throughout these episode.

  4 - Complex care package for adults
     The treatment plan for the client is primarily based around the delivery
     of an individually tailored 'package' of services for an adult client
     with severe and complex mental illness who is being managed principally
     within a primary care setting. The overarching requirement is the episode
     of care aims to bundle a range of services that extend beyond 'standard'
     service delivery where this would not otherwise not sufficiently meet
     clinical needs.

  5 - Child and youth-specific mental health services
     The treatment plan for the client is primarily based around the delivery
     of a range of services for children (0-11 years) or
     youth (aged 12-24 years) who present with a mental illness, or are at
     risk of mental illness. These episodes are characterised by services that
     are designed specifically for children and young people, include a broader
     range of both clinical and non-clinical services and may include a
     significant component of clinical care coordination and liaison.
     Child and youth-specific mental health episodes have substantial
     flexibility in types of services actually delivered.

  Describes the main type of service delivered in the contact, selected from a
  defined list of categories.  Where more than service type was provided select
  that which accounted for most provider time. Service providers are required
  to report on Service Type for all Service Contacts.

  1 - Assessment
    Determination of a person's mental health status and need for mental
    health services, made by a suitably trained mental health professional,
    based on the collection and evaluation of data obtained through interview
    and observation, of a person's history and presenting problem(s).
    Assessment may include consultation with the person's family and concludes
    with formation of problems/issues, documentation of a preliminary
    diagnosis, and a treatment plan.

  2 - Structured psychological intervention
    Those interventions which include a structured interaction between a
    client and a service provider using a recognised, psychological method,
    for example, cognitive behavioural techniques, family therapy or psycho
    education counselling. These are recognised, structured or published
    techniques for the treatment of mental ill-health. Structured psychological
    interventions are designed to alleviate psychological distress or
    emotional disturbance, change maladaptive behaviour and foster mental
    health. Structured psychological therapies can be delivered on either an
    individual or group basis, typically in an office or community setting.
    They may be delivered by trained mental health professionals or other
    individuals with appropriate competencies but who do not meet the
    requirements for registration, credentialing or recognition as a mental
    health professional. Structured Psychological Therapies include but are
    not limited to:

    - Psycho-education (including motivational interviewing)
    - Cognitive-behavioural therapies
    - Relaxation strategies
    - Skills training
    - Interpersonal therapy

  3 - Other psychological intervention
     Psychological interventions that do meet criteria for structured
     psychological intervention.

  4 - Clinical care coordination/liaison
     Activities focused on working in partnership and liaison with other
     health care and service providers and other individuals to coordinate
     and integrate service delivery to the client with the aim of improving
     their clinical outcomes. Consultation and liaison may occur with primary
     health care providers, acute health, emergency services, rehabilitation
     and support services, family, friends, other support people and carers
     and other agencies that have some level of responsibility for the
     client's treatment and/or well being.

  5 - Clinical nursing services
    Services delivered by mental health nurses that cannot be described
    elsewhere.  Typically, these aim to provide clinical support to clients
    to effectively manage their symptoms and avoid unnecessary hospitalisation.
    Clinical nursing services include:

    - monitoring a client's mental state;
    - liaising closely with family and carers as appropriate;
    - administering and monitoring compliance with medication;
    - providing information on physical health care, as required and,
      where appropriate, assist in addressing the physical health inequities
      of people with mental illness; and
    - improving links to other health professionals/clinical service providers.
