Organisations
=============

You will be able to see the Organisations tab if you have been assigned
the 'Organisation Management', or the 'User Management' role, , when logged into the PMHC MDS on https://pmhc-mds.net.

If you believe you should have access to an organisation and it doesn't appear
in your list please contact someone in that provider organisation or the
provider organisation's PHN who has the 'User Management' role.

If you are unsure who has the 'User Management' role please email the PMHC
helpdesk at support@pmhc-mds.com

After navigating to the organisation tab, you will be presented with a list of
top level organisations for which you have been assigned the 'Organisation Management'
or the 'User Management' role.
