Most government-based assistance or benefits schemes typically require the
presentation of an eligibility card of some sort at the time of the service
being provided, to establish the eligibility of the cardholder in relation to
receipt of the service or any associated benefit or subsidy.

For example, a Medicare card must be presented either by on or the behalf of a
patient visiting a general practitioner in order for a claim to be made for
benefits available under the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS).

Similarly, benefits available through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)
can only be claimed upon presentation of a valid Medicare card and/or another
applicable concession card.
