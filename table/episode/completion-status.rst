*Episode Completion Status* interacts with two other data items in the PMHC MDS -
*Service Contact - Final*, and *Episode End Date*.

*Service Contact - Final*
  Collection of data for *Service Contacts* includes a *Service Contact - Final*
  item that requires the service provider to indicate whether further Service
  Contacts are planned. Where this item is recorded as 'no further services
  planned', the *Episode Completion Status* should be recorded as code 1 (Episode
  closed - treatment concluded)

*Episode End Date*
  where a Final Service Contact is recorded and the *Episode Completion Status*
  field is recorded as code 1 (Episode closed - treatment concluded), *Episode
  End Date* should be recorded as the date of the final Service Contact.
