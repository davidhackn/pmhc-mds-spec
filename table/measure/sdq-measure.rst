The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a brief behavioural
screening questionnaire about 3-16 year olds. It exists in several versions to
meet the needs of researchers, clinicians and educationalists.

The "1" versions are administered on admission and are rated on the basis of
the proceeding 6 months. The "2" follow up versions are administered on review
and discharge and are rated on the basis of the previous 1 month period. The
versions specified for PMHC MDS reporting are:
- PC1 - SDQ Parent Report: 4-10 years (Baseline version);
- PC2 - SDQ Parent Report: 4-10 years (Follow up version);
- PY1 - SDQ Parent Report: 11-17 years (Baseline version);
- PY2 - SDQ Parent Report: 11-17 years (Follow up version);
- YR1 - SDQ Youth Report: 11-17 years (Baseline version); and
- YR2 - SDQ Youth Report: 11-17 years (Follow up version).

*We acknowledge that there is also a parent-report for 2-4 years; and teacher versions for all the years (2-4; 4-10 and 11-17) but that these are not to be reported the PMHC-MDS.*
