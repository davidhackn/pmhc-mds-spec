Note that this data item concerns only where the service contact took place.
It is not about where the client lives. Thus, if a resident of an aged care
residential facility is seen at another venue (e.g., at a GP Clinic), then
the Service Contact Venue should be recorded as ‘GP Practice’ (code 3) to
accurately reflect where the contact took place.

Values other than ‘98 - Not applicable’ only to be specified when Service Contact
Modality is ‘Face to Face’.

6 - Other primary care setting
  This code is suitable for primary care settings such as community health centres.

8 - Residential aged care facility
  Use this code when the client is seen at an aged care residential facility.

12 - Aged care centre - non-residential
  Use this code when the client is seen at a non-residential aged care centre
  (e.g., community day program centre for older people).

98 - Not applicable (Service Contact Modality is not face to face)
  This code must only to be used where the Service Contact Modality is not
  face to face

All other data items would be recorded as per the guidelines that apply to
those items – there are no special requirements specific to delivery of
services to residents of aged care facilities.  For example, any of the
episode of care types recorded under the Principal Focus of Treatment Plan
may apply; similarly, service contacts delivered to aged care residents may
be any of the options available in Service Contact Type field.

**Changes in effect from 1 January 2019**

Amendment has been made to the existing Service Contact Venue data item, to
enable better identification of residential aged care facilities. Specifically:
- the existing Code 8 (‘Aged Care Centre’) has been re-defined and titled ‘Residential Aged Care Facility’
- a new Service Contact code has been added (Code 12) for service contacts delivered in ‘Aged Care Centre – Non residential’

The data model and elements of the PMHC MDS provide a good fit for this measure,
with minimal adjustment required to enable reporting by service providers.
The only element requiring modification is the Service Contact Venue field,
to enable better identification of residential aged care facilities.

Reassignment of Code 8 is justified by its relatively low use (0.2% of service
contacts in 2017 18, approx. 1,300 contacts of 540,000 total) and the need to
create a new code for non-residential aged care centres.
