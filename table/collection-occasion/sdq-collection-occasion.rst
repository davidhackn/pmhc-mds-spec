The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a brief behavioural
screening questionnaire about 3-16 year olds. It exists in several versions to
meet the needs of researchers, clinicians and educationalists.

The "1" versions are administered on admission and are rated on the basis of
the proceeding 6 months. The "2" follow up versions are administered on review
