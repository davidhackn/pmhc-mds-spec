The K10+ Total score is based on the sum of K10+ item 01 through 10 (range: 10-50).
Items 11 through 14 are excluded from the total because they are separate
measures of disability associated with the problems referred to in the preceding
ten items.

As of 1st of November 2021, the Total score is calculated using a
pro-rated approach. The following formula is used with the proviso that a
completed K10+ with more than one missing item is regarded as invalid:

Total score = round( sum of valid scores / 9 * 10 )

For more information please refer to the `announcement on 30/8/2021 <https://pmhc-mds.com/communications/#/2021/08/30/notification-of-planned-K10-scoring-change/>`__.

If more than one item of items 1 to 10 are missing, the Total Score is set as
missing. Where this is the case, the missing value used should be 99.

When reporting individual item scores use ‘99 - Not stated / Missing’.
