The K10+ Total score is based on the sum of K10+ item 01 through 10 (range: 10-50).
Items 11 through 14 are excluded from the total because they are separate
measures of disability associated with the problems referred to in the preceding
ten items.

When reporting individual item scores the Total Score may be reported as
‘99 - Not stated / Missing’ and the system will calculate the Total Score as
documented below.

Where both item scores and a valid Total Score are reported, the item scores
must add up to the total score as documented below.

**Calculating the Total Score**

If any item has not been completed (that is, has not been coded 1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
it is excluded from the total and that item score is set to
‘9 - Not stated / Missing’ .

*9 or 10 valid items supplied*

As of 1st of November 2021, where there are 9 or 10 valid items supplied
for items 1 to 10, the Total Score is calculated using a pro-rated approach. The following
formula is used:

Total score = round( 10 * sum of valid scores / number of valid scores )

For more information please refer to the `announcement on 30/8/2021 <https://pmhc-mds.com/communications/#/2021/08/30/notification-of-planned-K10-scoring-change/>`__.

*Less that 9 valid items supplied*

Where there are less than 9 valid items supplied for items 1 to 10, the Total
Score is set as missing. Where this is the case, the missing value used is
‘99 - Not stated / Missing’.
