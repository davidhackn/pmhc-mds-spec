The K10 Total score is based on the sum of K10 item 01 through 10 (range: 10-50).
Items 11 through 14 are excluded from the total because they are separate
measures of disability associated with the problems referred to in the preceding
ten items.

The Total score is computed as the sum of the scores for items 1 to 10. If any
item has not been completed (that is, has not been coded 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), it is
excluded from the total with the proviso that a competed K10 with more than one
missing item is regarded as invalid.

If more than one item of items 1 to 10 are missing, the Total Score is set as
missing. Where this is the case, the missing value used should be 99.

When reporting individual item scores use ‘99 - Not stated / Missing’.

*K10+ Scoring change planned for last week of October 2021*

Using the above algorithm, a K10+ with one item missing and all other items
scored as 1 will be regarded as valid and have a total score of 9, however
the K10+ Total Score is defined as being in the range 10-50.

To resolve this issue,
The scoring for the K10+ will be changed to a pro-rated approach so that
the minimum total score is 10. The following formula will be used:

Total score = round( sum of valid scores / 9 * 10 )

Uploads that provide both the item scores and the total score will need to be
updated to use the new algorithm. Alternatively, uploads could be updated
to provide item scores and a total score of 99. Where item scores are provided
with a total of 99 the PMHC MDS will calculate the total score.

Where item scores have been provided, existing data will be recalculated to
use the new scoring.
