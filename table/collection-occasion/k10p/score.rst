The K10+ Total score is based on the sum of K10+ item 01 through 10 (range: 10-50).
Items 11 through 14 are excluded from the total because they are separate
measures of disability associated with the problems referred to in the preceding
ten items.

When reporting individual item scores use ‘99 - Not stated / Missing’.

**Calculating the Total Score**

If any item has not been completed (that is, has not been coded 1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
it is excluded from the total and that item score is set to
‘9 - Not stated / Missing’ .

*No missing item scores*

Where there are no missing item scores the Total Score is computed as the sum
of the scores for items 1 to 10.

*One missing item score*

As of 1st of November 2021, where one, and only one, item of items 1 to 10 is
missing the Total Score is calculated using a pro-rated approach. The following
formula is used:

Total score = round( sum of valid scores / 9 * 10 )

For more information please refer to the `announcement on 30/8/2021 <https://pmhc-mds.com/communications/#/2021/08/30/notification-of-planned-K10-scoring-change/>`__.

*More than one missing item score*

If more than one item of items 1 to 10 are missing, the Total Score is set as
missing. Where this is the case, the missing value used should be
‘99 - Not stated / Missing’.
