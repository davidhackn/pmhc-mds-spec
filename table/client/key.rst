Client keys must be unique within each Provider Organisation. The Client Key
will be managed by the Provider Organisation, however, the PHN may decide to
play a role in coordinating assignment and management of these client keys.
Clients should not be assigned multiple keys within the same Provider Organisation.

Client keys are case sensitive and must be valid unicode characters.
