Client keys must be unique within each PHN independent of the treating
organisation. It is the responsibility of PHNs and Provider Organisations to
co-ordinate to maintain this identifier. Clients should not be assigned
multiple keys within the same PHN.

Client keys are case sensitive and must be valid unicode characters.
