Client keys must be unique within each Provider Organisation. The Client Key
will be managed by the Provider Organisation, however, the PHN may decide to
play a role in coordinating assignment and management of these client keys.
Clients should not be assigned multiple keys within the same Provider Organisation.

See :ref:`Identifier Management <identifier_management>` and :ref:`client_keys`.
