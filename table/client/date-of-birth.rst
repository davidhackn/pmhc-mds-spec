If the date of birth is unknown, the following approaches should be used:

  - If the age of the person is known, the age should be used to derive the
    year of birth
  - If the age of the person is unknown, an estimated age of the person should
    be used to estimate a year of birth
  - An actual or estimated year of birth should then be converted into an
    estimated date of birth using the
    following convention: 0101Estimated year of birth.
  - If the date of birth is totally unknown, use 09099999.
  - If you have estimated the year of birth make sure you record this in the
    'Estimated date of birth flag'
