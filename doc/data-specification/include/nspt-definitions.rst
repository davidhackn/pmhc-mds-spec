.. _dfn-organisation_path:

Organisation Path
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A sequence of colon separated Organisation Keys that fully specifies the Provider Organisation providing a service to the client.

:Data type: string

:Required: true

:Notes:
  A combination of the Primary Health Network's (PHN's) Organisation Key and the
  Provider Organisation's Organisation Key separated by a colon.

  Here is an example organisation structure showing the Organisation Path for each organisation:

  +------------------+-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+---------------------+-------------------+
  | Organisation Key | Organisation Name             | Organisation Type                           | Parent Organisation | Organisation Path |
  +==================+===============================+=============================================+=====================+===================+

.. _dfn-episode_key:

Episode Key
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a number or code assigned to each episode. The Episode Key is unique and stable for each episode at the level of the organisation.

:Field name: episode_key

:Data type: string (2,50)

:Required: true
:Notes:
  Episode Keys must be generated by the organisation to be unique at the provider
  organisation level and must persist across time. Creation of episode keys in
  this way allows clients to be merged (where duplicate Client Keys have been
  identified) without having to re-allocate episode identifiers since they can
  never clash.

  A recommended approach for the creation of Episode Keys is to compute `random
  UUIDs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`_.

  the calculation and not counted as a valid item. If any item is missing, the
  Total Score is set as missing.
