contact someone in your provider organisation or provider organisation's PHN
who has the 'User Management' role.

If you are unsure who has the 'User Management' role please email the
PMHC helpdesk at support@pmhc-mds.com

After navigating to the Upload tab, you will be presented with a drop down list
of the organisations to which you can upload.
