Capturing additional data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It seems that the data being collected is quite limited, would it not be useful to collect more detailed information?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The development of the minimum dataset balanced the ideal against what was
realistic, given that any additional data item places extra burden on those
collecting and entering data.

Organisations may collect extra information for their own analysis however this
information does not need to be submitted to the PMHC MDS.

What are the options where the information collected does not fit into the available fields?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each data item has associated notes that provide guidance on which response to
use. Please refer to the data item documentation at :ref:`record-formats`. By clicking
on the field name this will take you to the field definition which outlines the associated notes.

Can we capture and record additional data?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PMHC MDS is designed to monitor and evaluate regional service delivery against
key mental health performance indicators. The PMHC MDS does not confine PHNs to
the data specified. Rather, it sets the minimum and common ground for what data
are to be collected and reported for mental health services commissioned by PHNs.
It is anticipated that many PHNs will seek to collect an enhanced set of data to
meet local needs, however this data will not be submitted to the MDS.
