.. _hardcory_archive_time_faq:

After entering data in the MDS how long should I store my hardcopy and/or electronic files?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no set time limit; however, it is recommend that you archive this data
and keep it secure for at least two years. As with all electronic data
(including MDS) there is a risk of corruption - whether it is due to a system
bug or human error. The MDS stores the original upload files as well as the
data that has been imported into the database, however it is always
good to keep the original data as a backup to either check details against or
re-enter, if needed.
