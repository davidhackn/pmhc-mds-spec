<p>Access to the PMHC MDS is based around roles. Each role allows a user to perform
specific tasks. A user can have more than one role. Each role is granted for a
user against an organisation. An organisation can either be a Primary Health
Network (PHN) or a Provider Organisation. If a user is granted a role for a
PHN they will also have this role for any Provider Organisations of that PHN. The following table
provides a summary of each of the roles that currently exist within the PMHC MDS:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="18%" />
<col width="82%" />
</colgroup>

</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Upload</td>
<td>A user with the Upload role can upload data to that organisation or its suborganisations</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>User accounts can be created by a user at your PHN or Provider Organisation who
has the User Management role. Please contact <a class="reference external" href="mailto:support&#37;&#52;&#48;pmhc-mds&#46;com">support<span>&#64;</span>pmhc-mds<span>&#46;</span>com</a> to find out
who has this access.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you cannot contact any users who have the User Management role
access can be gained by producing a <a class="reference internal" href="#letter-of-authority"><span class="std std-ref">Letter of Authority</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="letter-of-authority">
<span id="id1"></span><h3>Letter of Authority<a class="headerlink" href="#letter-of-authority" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>The protocol for setting up a new account to access the MDS requires a written
letter of authority. A <strong>letter of authority</strong> is a request made on your
Primary Health Network or Provider Organisation&#8217;s letterhead which must be
signed by an authority at the Primary Health Network or Provider Organisation
who holds a position that is higher than the person for whom the account is
being created (i.e., the person&#8217;s manager or the CEO).</p>
<p>This letter must contain the following details (for the person for whom
the MDS access is being requested):</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Name.</li>
<li>Email address.</li>
<li>Contact telephone number.</li>
<li>Mobile phone number.</li>
<li>The exact Primary Health Network or Provider Organisation&#8217;s name in the MDS
you are seeking to access.</li>
<li>The roles (PHN&#8217;s Primary Contact, Organisation Management, User Management, Upload)
required for the user. The user can have any combination of these roles.</li>
</ol>
<p>This letter must be faxed or scanned then emailed to:</p>
<p>Strategic Data Fax: (03) 9340 9090 or Email: <a class="reference external" href="mailto:support&#37;&#52;&#48;pmhc-mds&#46;com">support<span>&#64;</span>pmhc-mds<span>&#46;</span>com</a></p>
<p>The same protocol applies if an MDS user no longer requires MDS access and
needs to hand over their MDS access to another person. However, in this case
it is advised that the new MDS user has a new username and password issued to
protect the privacy and security of the organisation&#8217;s data.</p>
<p>This process will also apply where a user is requesting a password re-set.
However, the auto <a class="reference internal" href="#password-recovery"><span class="std std-ref">Password or username recovery</span></a> process available to you via the
MDS login screen is the preferred method of password retrieval.</p>
<p>If your email address or mobile number has changed, it is important that you update
your account. See <a class="reference internal" href="user-guide/home.html#updating-your-details"><span class="std std-ref">Updating your details</span></a>. If you can&#8217;t access your profile,
contact the PMHC helpdesk so that your records can be updated. When contacting the
PMHC helpdesk you will be asked to arrange for a <a class="reference internal" href="#letter-of-authority"><span class="std std-ref">Letter of Authority</span></a> stating
the change(s) and this must then be sent to Strategic Data via fax or scan/email as documented above.</p>

<p>The system offers an automated password/username recovery feature. The system
will email the registered email address on your account and send an SMS to

<p>Yes, GPs and MHPs can access the MDS to upload their data directly into the
system. However, it is not possible to limit their data access to the
select data fields that they would normally manage. For example, MHPs would
normally only need to enter or edit their own client information and the episodes
and service contacts associated with these clients.</p>
<p>However, it is not possible to restrict their access only to their own clients&#8217;
data. They will be able to modify data for clients across their entire provider
organisation. Therefore, MHPs who access the MDS could potentially change data
for a client that is not their own.</p>

<p>Yes, we can supply you with an account that has access to a test Primary Health

<p>In order to set up the test Primary Health Network account we need to follow a
similar procedure to setting up a proper Primary Health Network account. To do
that we require a <a class="reference internal" href="#letter-of-authority"><span class="std std-ref">Letter of Authority</span></a> as detailed in the Letter of
Authority section above.</p>

<h3>What is the best way to manage the client key?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-best-way-to-manage-the-client-key" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>The SLK isnâ€™t necessarily a unique key and therefore the Client Key is required
to be a unique client identifier. The Client Key needs to be stable for each
individual within the PHN.</p>
<p>Initially the PHN will need to play a role in coordinating assignment and management
of these keys for Provider Organisations, prior to the PMHC MDS implementation a
Master Client Index during Stage 2 of development.</p>

<h3>Can you suggest a best practice approach to managing client keys?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-you-suggest-a-best-practice-approach-to-managing-client-keys" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>We understand that PHNs approach <a class="reference internal" href="identifier-management.html#identifier-management"><span class="std std-ref">Identifier management</span></a> in various different ways
to best suit their practice. PHNs will continue to manage client keys until the
Master Client Index is developed and released in Stage 2. In the interim, we suggest
speaking with another PHN in your network to understand their approach to managing
their client keys.</p>

<h3>How will the Master Client Index work?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-will-the-master-client-index-work" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>During Stage 2 of the PMHC MDS implementation a Master Client Index will be created
to allow Provider Organisations to manage the <a class="reference internal" href="identifier-management.html#client-keys"><span class="std std-ref">Managing Client Keys</span></a> across PHNs. Stage 2
development updates will be released by the Department of Health in the lead up to
release. Regularly check the announcements on the home page (<a class="reference external" href="https://pmhc-mds.net/">https://pmhc-mds.net/</a>) to keep informed.</p>

<p>Provider Organisations should make every effort to ensure that the data entered
into the MDS is as complete as possible. However, most data items specify
a &#8216;Missing&#8217; response. Where information is unavailable, please use this
response item. The aim is to minimise missing data as much as possible.</p>

<p>The development of the minimum dataset balanced the ideal against what was
realistic, given that any additional data item places extra burden on those
collecting and entering data.</p>

<h2>Checking data<a class="headerlink" href="#checking-data" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>Each individual organisation is responsible for checking their data in the
MDS to confirm its accuracy and completion. It is advisable that this review
is undertaken regularly to ensure data integrity and avoid widespread errors.</p>
<p>Alternatively, for greater precision and to access your data in full, you can
download your data.</p>

<p>There is no set time limit; however, it is recommend that you archive this data
and keep it secure for at least two years. As with all electronic data
(including MDS) there is a risk of corruption - whether it is due to a system
bug or human error. The MDS stores the original upload files as well as the
data that has been imported into the database, however it is always
good to keep the original data as a backup to either check details against or
re-enter, if needed.</p>
