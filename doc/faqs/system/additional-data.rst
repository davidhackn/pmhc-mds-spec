Capturing additional data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _limited_data_faq:

It seems that the data being collected is quite limited, would it not be useful to collect more detailed information?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The development of the minimum dataset balanced the ideal against what was
realistic, given that any additional data item places extra burden on those
collecting and entering data.

Organisations may collect extra information for their own analysis however this
information does not need to be submitted to the PMHC MDS.

Refer to :ref:`data_does_not_fit_faq`

.. _add_another_field_faq:

The information collected does not fit into the available fields. Can we add another option?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The development of the minimum dataset balanced the ideal against what was
realistic, given that any additional data item places extra burden on those
collecting and entering data.

.. _record_additional_data_faq:

Can the PMHC MDS capture and record additional data?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PMHC MDS is designed to monitor and evaluate regional service delivery
against key mental health performance indicators and can not capture and record
additional data outside the :ref:`data-model`.

The PMHC MDS does not confine PHNs to the data specified. Rather, it sets the
minimum and common ground for what data are to be collected and reported for
mental health services commissioned by PHNs.

It is anticipated that many PHNs will seek to collect and manage an enhanced set
of data to meet local needs, however this data will not be submitted to the MDS.
