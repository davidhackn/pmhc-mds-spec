Entering data in the PMHC Minimum Data Set
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What is the best way to manage the client key?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SLK isn’t necessarily a unique key and therefore the Client Key is required
to be a unique client identifier. The Client Key needs to be stable for each
individual within the PHN.

Initially the PHN will need to play a role in coordinating assignment and management
of these keys for Provider Organisations, prior to the PMHC MDS implementation a
Master Client Index during Stage 2 of development.

Please refer to :ref:`identifier_management`.

Can you suggest a best practice approach to managing client keys?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We understand that PHNs approach :ref:`identifier_management` in various different ways
to best suit their practice. PHNs will continue to manage client keys until the
Master Client Index is developed and released in Stage 2. In the interim, we suggest
speaking with another PHN in your network to understand their approach to managing
their client keys.

How will the Master Client Index work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During Stage 2 of the PMHC MDS implementation a Master Client Index will be created
to allow Provider Organisations to manage the :ref:`client_keys` across PHNs. Stage 2
development updates will be released by the Department of Health in the lead up to
release. Regularly check the announcements on the home page (https://pmhc-mds.net/) to keep informed.

How often should I enter data into the MDS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please refer to :ref:`reporting_timeliness`.

What do I do If the GP / mental health provider has not given an answer to one or more questions in the minimum dataset?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provider Organisations should make every effort to ensure that the data entered
into the MDS is as complete as possible. However, most data items specify
a 'Missing' response. Where information is unavailable, please use this
response item. The aim is to minimise missing data as much as possible.

Can I go back and enter information if I don’t have it at the time?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, the MDS allows you to go back and enter information at a later date.

Can I enter fictitious data as a part of testing?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MDS is live and data uploads will be recorded. Real PMHC data can be trialled
by uploading in test mode, whereas fictitious data should be trialled with a
'Test Organisation' on developers.pmhc-mds.net.  See the Developers announcement at https://www.pmhc-mds.com/2017/02/17/Separate-PMHC-MDS-now-available-for-software-developers-to-test-upload-files/.

Where do I enter MHNIPS data collection?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Department of Health is expecting all commissioned Mental Health Nursing services data from July 2016 to be entered into the PMHC MDS.

The PHMC MDS specifications seems limited. Can we capture and record additional data?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PMHC MDS is designed to monitor and evaluate regional service delivery against
key mental health performance indicators. The PMHC MDS does not confine PHNs to
the data specified. Rather, it sets the minimum and common ground for what data
are to be collected and reported for mental health services commissioned by PHNs.
It is anticipated that many PHNs will seek to collect an enhanced set of data to
meet local needs, however this data will not be submitted to the MDS.
