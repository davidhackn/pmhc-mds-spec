How do I obtain access to the PMHC MDS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Access to the PMHC MDS is based around roles. Each role allows a user to perform
specific tasks. A user can have more than one role. Each role is granted for a
user against an organisation. An organisation can either be a Primary Health
Network (PHN) or a Provider Organisation. If a user is granted a role for a
PHN they will also have this role for any Provider Organisations of that PHN.
See :ref:`roles` for a summary of each of the roles that currently exist within the PMHC MDS:

User accounts can be created by a user at your PHN or Provider Organisation who
has the User Management role. If unsure who this is, please contact support@pmhc-mds.com
to find out who has this access.

Alternatively, if you cannot contact any users who have the User Management role
access can be gained by producing a :ref:`letter-of-authority`.

.. _letter-of-authority:

Letter of Authority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The protocol for setting up a new account to access the MDS requires a written
letter of authority. A **letter of authority** is a request made on your
Primary Health Network or Provider Organisation's letterhead which must be
signed by an authority at the Primary Health Network or Provider Organisation
who holds a position that is higher than the person for whom the account is
being created (i.e., the person's manager or the CEO).

This letter must contain the following details (for the person for whom
the MDS access is being requested):

#. Name.
#. Email address.
#. Contact telephone number.
#. Mobile phone number.
#. The exact Primary Health Network or Provider Organisation's name in the MDS
   you are seeking to access.
#. The roles (PHN's Primary Contact, Organisation Management, User Management, Upload)
   required for the user. The user can have any combination of these roles.

This letter must be faxed or scanned then emailed to:

Strategic Data Fax: (03) 9340 9090 or Email: support@pmhc-mds.com

The same protocol applies if an MDS user no longer requires MDS access and
needs to hand over their MDS access to another person. However, in this case
it is advised that the new MDS user has a new username and password issued to
protect the privacy and security of the organisation's data.

This process will also apply where a user is requesting a password re-set.
However, the auto :ref:`password-recovery` process available to you via the
MDS login screen is the preferred method of password retrieval.

If your email address or mobile number has changed, it is important that you update
your account. See :ref:`updating_your_details`. If you can't access your profile,
contact the PMHC helpdesk so that your records can be updated. When contacting the
PMHC helpdesk you will be asked to arrange for a :ref:`letter-of-authority` stating
the change(s) and this must then be sent to Strategic Data via fax or scan/email as documented above.

.. _I-do-not-have-a-work-mobile:

I do not have a work mobile. What do I do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A user can use their personal mobile. The mobile is only used by the PMHC MDS
profile management system to deliver the verification code via SMS. This is usedÂ 
to activate their profile, reset their password or if a password is forgotten or
expires. Users' mobile phone numbers are not listed or able to be viewed by other
users within the PMHC MDS

Can I invite different users by using the same mobile?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is not advised for multiple PMHC users to share using the same mobile number.
Please refer to :ref:`I-do-not-have-a-work-mobile` and :ref:`password-recovery` for more information.

.. _password-recovery:

Password or username recovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The system offers an automated password/username recovery feature. The system
will email the registered email address on your account and send an SMS to
the registered mobile phone on your account. See :ref:`forgotten_password`
for instructions on resetting your password.

It is important to keep your email address and mobile phone current so that
you can make use of this facility. If you can no longer access the PMHC MDS
please email the PMHC MDS helpdesk at support@pmhc-mds.com to update your
email address/mobile phone. Please note that a :ref:`letter-of-authority` will
need to be produced in order for the PMHC MDS helpdesk to update your account.

I forgot my password. What do I do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See :ref:`forgotten_password`.

What can a user see in the MDS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What you see once you login will depend upon what roles you have been assigned.
See :ref:`roles` for more information.

How do I get started using the MDS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please refer to :ref:`how-do-i-obtain-access-to-the-mds` for information on
getting an account on the MDS.

The PMHC website is available at https://pmhc-mds.com/. Here you will find
documentation on using the MDS.

The MDS is accessed on the web at the following address: https://pmhc-mds.net/

Can I pass on my username and password to my organisation's IT person or evaluator if they are entering data?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No, each user should be issued with their own username and password. Please
refer to :ref:`how-do-i-obtain-access-to-the-mds` for information on how to
get an account.

Can I add an existing user to another PHN or Provider Organisation?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. By ensuring you enter the same email and mobile number when completing the
steps in :ref:`adding_an_exsisting_user`, the system will automatically pick up if a user
already exists in the PMHC MDS and will grant them access to the additional organisation.

Why did I get this message '500 Internal Server Error: add: Inviting user failed: An outstanding PMHC MDS invite exists' when inviting a user?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This user has previously been invited and has not yet completed the required
steps for :ref:`accepting_invitation`. An invitation will be valid for 7 days
and you can not resend an invitation within this time whilst a token is still valid.

What should you do if a user didn't receive the email invitation?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Firstly confirm that you have their correct email address.  Ask the user to
double check their junk mail folder and search for an email sent from
noreply@strategicdata.com.au. Otherwise, please contact the helpdesk on support@pmhc-mds.com.

What should you do if a user deleted the email invitation or the SMS token?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a user didn't receive or deleted the email invitation or the SMS token, ask them
to contact the helpdesk on support@pmhc-mds.com as we can reissue it.

Can GPs or Mental Health Providers (MHPs) access the MDS to upload data themselves?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, GPs and MHPs can access the MDS to upload their data directly into the
system. However, it is not possible to limit their data access to the
select data fields that they would normally manage. For example, MHPs would
normally only need to enter or edit their own client information and the episodes
and service contacts associated with these clients.

However, it is not possible to restrict their access only to their own clients'
data. They will be able to modify data for clients across their entire provider
organisation. Therefore, MHPs who access the MDS could potentially change data
for a client that is not their own.

I'm a third-party software developer developing software to assist with uploading data to the MDS. Can I have an account to test my data uploads?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, we can supply you with an account that has access to a test Primary Health
Network.

In order to set up the test Primary Health Network account we need to follow a
similar procedure to setting up a proper Primary Health Network account. To do
that we require a :ref:`letter-of-authority` as detailed in the Letter of
Authority section above, which must be signed by an authority at the Primary Health Network
or Provider Organisation who holds a position that is higher than the person for
whom the account is being created (i.e., the person's manager or the CEO).

Could you please provide a similar letter to :ref:`letter-of-authority` on your
company's letterhead containing the following details:

#. The name of the person the account is for
#. The email address of the person
#. Contact telephone number
#. Mobile phone number
#. Request access to the 'Test [Your Company Name]' Organisation

This letter must be faxed or scanned then emailed to:

Strategic Data Fax: (03) 9340 9090 or Email: support@pmhc-mds.com
