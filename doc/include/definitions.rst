----------

Episode - End Date
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The date on which an *Episode of Care* is formally or administratively ended

:Field name: episode_end_date

:Data type: date
:Notes:
  An *Episode of Care* may be ended in one of two ways:
  
  - clinically, consequent upon conclusion of treatment for the client and
    discharge from care; or
  
  - administratively (statistically), where contact with the client has been lost
    by the organisation prior to completion of treatment or other factors
    prevented treatment being completed.
  
  *Episode End Date* interacts with two other data items in the PMHC MDS - *Service
  Contact - Final*, and *Episode Completion Status*.
  
  *Service Contact - Final*
    Collection of data for *Service Contacts* includes a 'Final Service Contact'
    item that requires the service provider to indicate whether further *Service
    Contacts* are planned. Where this item is recorded as â€˜no further services
    plannedâ€™, the date of the final *Service Contact* should be recorded as the
    *Episode End Date*.
  
  *Episode Completion Status*
    This field should be recorded as 'Episode closed treatment concluded' when a
    *Service Contact - Final* is recorded. The *Episode Completion Status* field
    can also be manually recorded to allow for administrative closure of episodes
    (e.g., contact has been lost with a client over a prolonged period - see
    *Episode Completion Status* for additional guidance). Where an episode is
    closed administratively, the *Episode End Date* should be recorded as the
    date on which the organisation made the decision to close episode.

  benefits available under the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS).
  
  Similarly, benefits available through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)
  can only be claimed upon presentation of a valid Medicare card and/or another
  applicable concession card.

  - 3xx - Substance use disorders
  - 4xx - Psychotic disorder
  - 5xx - Disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence not listed elsewhere 
  - 6xx - Other mental disorder
  - 9xx - No formal mental disorder but subsyndromal problem
  
  The Principal Diagnosis should be determined by the treating or supervising
  clinical practitioner who is responsible for providing, or overseeing, services
  delivered to the client during their current episode of care. Each episode of
  care must have a Principal Diagnosis recorded and may have an Additional
  Diagnoses. In some instances the clientâ€™s Principal Diagnosis may not be clear
  at initial contact and require a period of contact before a reliable diagnosis
  can be made. If a client has more than one diagnosis, the Principal Diagnosis
  should reflect the main presenting problem. Any secondary diagnosis should be
  recorded under the Additional Diagnosis field.
  
  The coding options developed for the PMHC MDS have been selected to balance
  comprehensiveness and brevity. They comprise a mix of the most prevalent mental
  disorders in the Australian adult, child and adolescent population,
  supplemented by less prevalent conditions that may be experienced by clients of
  PHN-commissioned mental health services. The diagnosis options are based on an
  abbreviated set of clinical terms and groupings specified in the Diagnostic and
  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV-TR) (add link to
  reference below). These code list summarises the approximate 300 unique mental
  health disorder codes in the full DSM-IV to a set to 9 major categories, and 37
  individual codes. Diagnoses are grouped under higher level categories, based on
  the DSM-IV. Code numbers have been assigned specifically for the PMHC MDS to
  create a logical ordering but are capable of being mapped to both DSM-IV and
  ICD-10 codes.
  
  Options for recording Principal Diagnosis include the broad category â€˜No formal

Episode - Principal Focus of Treatment Plan
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The range of activities that best describes the overall services intended to be delivered to the client throughout the course of the episode. For most clients, this will equate to the activities that account for most time spent by the service provider.

:Field name: principal_focus

:Data type: string

:Domain:
  :1: Psychological therapy
  :2: Low intensity psychological intervention
  :3: Clinical care coordination
  :4: Complex care package for adults
  :5: Child and youth-specific mental health services
  :6: Indigenous-specific mental health services
  :7: Other
:Notes:
  Describes the main focus of the services to be delivered to the client for the
  current Episode of Care, selected from a defined list of categories.
  
  Service providers are required to report on the 'Principal Focus of Treatment
  Plan' for all accepted referrals. This requires a judgement to be made about
  the main focus of the services to be delivered to the client for the current
  Episode of Care, made following initial assessment and modifiable at a later
  stage. It is chosen from a defined list of categories, with the provider
  required to select the category that best fits the treatment plan designed for
  the client.
  
  Principal Focus of Treatment Plan is necessarily a judgement made by the
  provider at the outset of service delivery but consistent with good practice,
  should be made on the basis of a treatment plan developed in collaboration with
  the client. It should not be confused with Service Type which is collected at
  each Service Contact.
  
  1 - Psychological therapy
    The treatment plan for the client is primarily based around the delivery of
    psychological therapy by one or more mental health professionals. This
    category most closely matches the type of services delivered under the
    previous ATAPS program where up to 12 individual treatment sessions, and 18
    in exceptional circumstances, could be provided. These sessions could be
    supplemented by up to 10 group-based sessions.
  
    The concept of 'mental health professionals' has a specific meaning defined
    in the various guidance documentation prepared to support PHNs in
    implementation of reforms. It refers to service providers who meet the
    requirements for registration, credentialing or recognition as a qualified
    mental health professional and includes:
  
    - Psychiatrists
    - Registered Psychologists
    - Clinical Psychologists
    - Mental Health Nurses;
    - Occupational Therapists;
    - Social Workers
    - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health workers.
  
  2 - Low intensity psychological intervention
    The treatment plan for the client is primarily based around delivery of
    time-limited, structured psychological interventions that are aimed at
    providing a less costly intervention alternative to 'standard' psychological
    therapy. The essence of low intensity interventions is that they utilise nil
    or relatively little qualified mental health professional time and are
    targeted at people with, or at risk of, mild mental illness. Low intensity
    episodes can be delivered through a range of mechanisms including:
  
    - use of individuals with appropriate competencies but who do not meet the
      requirements for registration, credentialing or recognition as a mental
      health professional;
    - delivery of services principally through group-based programs; and
    - delivery of brief or low cost forms of treatment by mental health
      professionals.
  
  3 - Clinical care coordination
    The treatment plan for the client is primarily based around delivery of a
    range of services where the overarching aim is to coordinate and better
    integrate care for the individual across multiple providers. Clinical care
    coordination and liaison activities account for a significant proportion of
    service contacts delivered throughout these episodes.
  
    Activities focused on working in partnership and liaison with other health
    care and service providers and other individuals to coordinate and integrate
    service delivery to the client with the aim of improving their clinical
    outcomes. Consultation and liaison may occur with primary health care
    providers, acute health, emergency services, rehabilitation and support
    services, family, friends, other support people and carers and other agencies
    that have some level of responsibility for the clientâ€™s treatment and/or
    well-being.
  
  4 - Complex care package for adults
    The treatment plan for the client is primarily based around the delivery of
    an individually tailored 'package' of services for an adult client with
    severe and complex mental illness who is being managed principally within a
    primary care setting. The overarching requirement is the episode of care aims
    to bundle a range of services that extend beyond 'standard' service delivery
    where this would not otherwise not sufficiently meet clinical needs.
    
  5 - Child and youth-specific mental health services
    The treatment plan for the client is primarily based around the delivery of a
    range of services for children (0-11 years) or youth (aged 12-24 years) who
    present with a mental illness, or are at risk of mental illness. These
    episodes are characterised by services that are designed specifically for
    children and young people, include a broader range of both clinical and
    non-clinical services and may include a significant component of clinical
    care coordination and liaison. Child and youth-specific mental health
    episodes have substantial flexibility in types of services actually delivered.
    
  6 - Indigenous-specific services
    The treatment plan for the client is primarily based around delivery of
    mental health services that are specifically designed to provide culturally
    appropriate services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.
  
  7 - Other
     The treatment plan for the client is primarily based around services
     that cannot be described by other categories.

:Notes:
  This data standard is not applicable to person's aged less than 16 years.
  
  This item refers to the source by which a person derives most (equal to or
  greater than 50%) of his/her income. If the person has multiple sources of
  income and none are equal to or greater than 50%, the one which contributes
  the largest percentage should be counted.

  organisation level and must persist across time. Creation of episode keys in
  this way allows clients to be merged (where duplicate Client Keys have been
  identified) without having to re-allocate episode identifiers since they can
  never clash.
  
  A recommended approach for the creation of Episode Keys is to compute `random
  UUIDs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`_.

  Describes the main type of service delivered in the contact, selected from a
  defined list of categories.  Where more than service type was provided select
  that which accounted for most provider time. Service providers are required
  to report on Service Type for all Service Contacts.
  
  1 - Assessment
    Determination of a person's mental health status and need for mental
    health services, made by a suitably trained mental health professional,
    based on the collection and evaluation of data obtained through interview
    and observation, of a person's history and presenting problem(s).
    Assessment may include consultation with the person's family and concludes
    with formation of problems/issues, documentation of a preliminary
    diagnosis, and a treatment plan.
  
  2 - Structured psychological intervention
    Those interventions which include a structured interaction between a
    client and a service provider using a recognised, psychological method,
    for example, cognitive behavioural techniques, family therapy or psycho
    education counselling. These are recognised, structured or published
    techniques for the treatment of mental ill-health. Structured psychological
    interventions are designed to alleviate psychological distress or
    emotional disturbance, change maladaptive behaviour and foster mental
    health. Structured psychological therapies can be delivered on either an
    individual or group basis, typically in an office or community setting.
    They may be delivered by trained mental health professionals or other
    individuals with appropriate competencies but who do not meet the
    requirements for registration, credentialing or recognition as a mental
    health professional. Structured Psychological Therapies include but are
    not limited to:
  
    - Psycho-education (including motivational interviewing)
    - Cognitive-behavioural therapies
    - Relaxation strategies
    - Skills training
    - Interpersonal therapy
  
  3 - Other psychological intervention
     Psychological interventions that do meet criteria for structured
     psychological intervention.
  
  4 - Clinical care coordination/liaison
     Activities focused on working in partnership and liaison with other
     health care and service providers and other individuals to coordinate
     and integrate service delivery to the client with the aim of improving
     their clinical outcomes. Consultation and liaison may occur with primary
     health care providers, acute health, emergency services, rehabilitation
     and support services, family, friends, other support people and carers
     and other agencies that have some level of responsibility for the
     client's treatment and/or well being.
  
  5 - Clinical nursing services
    Services delivered by mental health nurses that cannot be described
    elsewhere.  Typically, these aim to provide clinical support to clients
    to effectively manage their symptoms and avoid unnecessary hospitalisation.
    Clinical nursing services include:
  
    - monitoring a client's mental state;
    - liaising closely with family and carers as appropriate;
    - administering and monitoring compliance with medication;
    - providing information on physical health care, as required and,
      where appropriate, assist in addressing the physical health inequities
      of people with mental illness; and
    - improving links to other health professionals/clinical service providers.
  
  6 - Child or youth-specific assistance NEC
    Services delivered to, or on behalf, of a child or young person that cannot
    be described elsewhere. These can include, for example, working with a
    childâ€™s teacher to provide advice on assisting the child in their educational
    environment; working with a young person's employer to assist the young
    person to their work environment.
    
    *Note: This code should only be used for
    Service Contacts that cannot be described by any other Service Type. It is
    expected that the majority of Service Contacts delivered to children and
    young people can be assigned to other categories*
  
  7 - Suicide prevention specific assistance NEC
    Services delivered to, or on behalf, of a client who presents with risk of
    suicide that cannot be described elsewhere. These can include, for example,
    working with the person's employers to advise on changes in the workplace;
    working with a young person's teacher to assist the child in their school
    environment; or working with relevant community-based groups to assist the
    client to participate in their activities.
  
    *Note: This code should only be used for Service Contacts that cannot be
    described by any other Service Type. It is expected that the majority of
    Service Contacts delivered to clientâ€™s who have a risk of suicide can be
    assigned to other categories.*
  
  8 - Cultural specific assistance NEC
    Services delivered to, or on behalf, of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait
    Islander client that cannot be described elsewhere. These can include, for
    example, working with the clientâ€™s community network ... **(more to be
    added)**
  
    *Note: This code should only be used for Service Contacts that cannot be
    described by any other Service Type. It is expected that the majority of
    Service Contacts delivered to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander clientâ€™s
    can be assigned to other categories.*
