How do I obtain access to the MDS?
----------------------------------

Since the upgrade of the MDS to PMHC version 1.0 (on XX XXXX 2016), access to the MDS can be provided at three levels:

+--------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Access Level**   | **Functionality provided**                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **How to get an account with this level of access**                                                                                                                                                            |

.. _Letter-of-Authority:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Letter of Authority
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The protocol for setting up a new ID to access the MDS requires a written letter of authority. A **letter of authority** is a request made on your Primary Health Network or Non-Government Health Organisation's letterhead which must be signed by an authority at the Primary Health Network or Non-Government Health Organisation who holds a position that is higher than the person for whom the account is being created (i.e., the person's manager or the CEO).

This letter must contain the following details (for the person for whom the MDS access is being requested):

#. Name
#. Email address
#. Contact telephone number
#. Mobile phone number
#. The exact Primary Health Network or Non-Government Health Organisation name in the MDS you are seeking access to
#. The level of access (Division or Data Entry) required for the user

This letter must be faxed or scanned then emailed to:

Strategic Data Fax: (03) 9340 9090 or Email: support@pmhc-mds.com

The same protocol applies if an MDS user no longer requires MDS access and needs to hand over their MDS access to another person. However, in this case it is advised that the new MDS user has a new username and password issued to protect the privacy and security of the organisation's data.

This process will also apply where a user is requesting a password re-set. However, the auto :ref:`password-recovery` process available to you via the MDS login screen is the preferred method of password retrieval.

If your email address has changed, it is important that you update your account or notify your Division level user or the PMHC helpdesk so that your records can be updated. When contacting the PMHC helpdesk you will be asked to arrange for a letter of authority stating the change(s) and this must then be sent to Strategic Data via fax or scan/email.

.. _password-recovery:
-----------------------------
Password or username recovery
-----------------------------

Since the upgrade of the MDS to PMHC version 1.0 (on XX XXXX 2016), the system offers an automated password/username recovery feature. The system will email the registered email address on your account with your username and instructions on how to reset your password. (Therefore it is important to keep your email address current. Please contact your organisation's Divison level user or email the PMHC helpdesk at support@pmhc-mds.com to update your email address on your MDS user account. Please note that a 'Letter of Authority' will need to be produced in order for the PMHC helpdesk to reset your password, as email addresses are key identifiers for security.)

-----------------------------------
I forgot my password. What do I do?
-----------------------------------

Try using the automated password/username recovery feature. If you still cannot access your account, please contact your Primary Health Network Division level user who will be able to reset your password. If you are unsure who your Division level user is please email the PMHC helpdesk at support@pmhc-mds.com. If you are a Division Level user, please email the PMHC helpdesk at support@pmhc-mds.com. A :ref:`'Letter-of-Authority'` requesting a password reset will need to be produced in order for the PMHC helpdesk to reset your password.

-----------------------------------
How do I get started using the MDS?
-----------------------------------

Please refer to :ref:`'How-do-I-obtain-access-to-the-MDS?'` for information on getting an account on the MDS.

The MDS website is available at https://pmhc-mds.com/. Here you will find documentation on using the MDS.

The MDS is accessed on the web at the following address: https://pmhc-mds.net/

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can I pass on my username and password to the Primary Health Network's IT person or evaluator if they are entering data?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, each user should now be issued with their own username and password. Please have the user who has 'Division'-level access in your Primary Health Network create a separate account for the Primary Health Network's IT person or evaluator.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can GPs or Mental Health Providers (MHPs) access the MDS to enter data themselves?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, GPs and MHPs can access the MDS to enter their data directly into the system. However, it is not possible to limit their data entry access to the select data fields that they would normally manage. For example, MHPs would normally only need to enter or edit ‘service contact’ data in the MDS. However, it is not possible to restrict their access only to these fields. Therefore, MHPs who access the MDS could potentially change ‘client’ and ‘episode’ data as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm a third-party software developer developing software to assist with uploading data to the MDS. Can I have an account to test my data uploads?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, we can supply you with an account that has access to a test Primary Health Network.

In order to set up the test Primary Health Network account we need to follow a similar procedure to setting up a proper Primary Health Network account. To do that we require a :ref:`Letter-of-Authority` as detailed in the Letter of Authority section above.

Could you please provide a similar letter on your company's letterhead containing the following details:

#. The name of the person the account is for
#. The email address of the person
#. Contact telephone number
#. Request access to the 'Test [Your Company Name]' Organisation

This letter must be faxed or scanned then emailed to:

Strategic Data Fax: (03) 9340 9090 or Email: support@pmhc-mds.com

===========================================
Entering data in the minimum dataset system
===========================================

-------
General
-------

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
How often should I enter data into the MDS?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ideally, data should be entered into the MDS as soon as it becomes available so that at any given time data can be downloaded nationally to provide an overall picture of service provision via the project. Data should be entered as frequently as is possible and reasonable but ideally should not lag by more than a month.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We are collecting additional data, such as a client satisfaction survey. Is this supposed to be added to the minimum dataset and hence be given to the Commonwealth, or should we literally only report the minimum data?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data from the MDS will be used as the basis for periodic national evaluation reports, prepared by the national evaluation team for the Commonwealth. The additional data that you are collecting will go into your local evaluation report but does not need to be added to the MDS or given to the Commonwealth in raw data form.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
What do I do If the GP / mental health provider has not given an answer to one or more questions in the minimum dataset?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Primary Health Networks should make every effort to ensure that the data entered into the MDS are as complete as possible. However, where information is unavailable, please leave the field blank. The aim is to minimise missing data as much as possible.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Where fields are consistently filled with the same response (e.g., zero for co-payment where the Primary Health Network is not collecting a co-payment), can the minimum dataset be set to automatically fill this field with the same response each time information is entered? How can this be done?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Strategic Data can create a template to auto fill this information for you. Such customisations are outside of the Commonwealth funding for the MDS, so such modifications would be billable to your Primary Health Network, and the exact cost would depend on the amount and type of customisations required. Contact the support team via e-mail to support@pmhc-mds.com to discuss your requirements.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Can I go back and enter information if I don’t have it at the time?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes, the MDS allows you to go back and enter information at a later date.

------------
Client data
------------

^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SLK mandatory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All client records require an SLK (Statistical Linkage Key) if they have an associated episode or service contact dated 1st June 2013 or later.  This field has become a mandatory reporting item and is outlined here: https://pmhc-mds.com//mds/user-documentation/slk/

Note: once you save/upload a client record and assign an SLK, you will not be able to delete or remove the SLK - you can, however, edit the SLK for such records.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If children are under PMHC, what happens to data on them with regard to the minimum dataset?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MDS largely mirrors the data that would be being collected by Primary Health Networks for administrative purposes. No names are supplied to the MDS for evaluation purposes, and clients will not be identified by local or national evaluators. The issue is really about whether informed consent needs to be elicited from minors to receive services, and this is more an implementation question than an evaluation question.

-------------
Episode data
-------------

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
How do I add a new episode to a new client?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You first need to complete the new client data in order to enter episode data. Once this has been done, you can then proceed to enter your episode data in the 'episode' section of the online form.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
How do I add a new episode to an existing client?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**If entering data individually into the MDS:** When in your client record in the MDS, locate the 'Episodes' box on the right. To the far right you will see a link "New". Click on this link and this will enable you to add your new episode data against the existing client. This will also enable you to enter new scores for any outcome measures you wish to record for service contacts completed against this new episode.

**If doing a bulk upload:** Simply add a new line entry into your 'Episode' file and assign a new episode code against an existing client key.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When is it appropriate to add a new episode to an existing client?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
PMHC allows for up to 12 service contacts (6 + 6) per client within a calendar year. When clients complete their first 6 service contacts, they are required to obtain agreement from their referring practitioner (e.g., GP) for continuation of treatment, whereby a further 6 service contacts can be allocated. This review is NOT considered a new episode unless the client has developed a new mental health problem or is being referred to a different MHP. (In exceptional circumstances, an additional 6 service contacts might be allocated for a maximum of 18 service contacts within a calendar year period.) Also, service contacts that continue under an existing treatment plan into a new calendar year do not require a new episode.

A new episode is issued under the following circumstances:

* a new client is referred for the first time for a presenting mental health condition
* an existing client has presented with a new mental health condition and is being referred for treatment.

It is important to maintain the same client key for a single client within the MDS regardless of the number of episodes in order to identify how many service contacts in total each client has had across the lifespan of the program.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
How can I change the episode type for a client?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of the limitations to the MDS is that once the 'episode type' has been selected and saved for a record it cannot be changed. Each 'episode type' has its own set of associated data fields which are generated once this field is set. Therefore we have intentionally disabled the edit function linked to this field to circumvent any accidental loss of data.

Therefore the only way to change a 'episode type' is to re-enter the entire record again with the correct 'episode type' and delete the incorrect record.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Episodes for children
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PMHC Operational Guidelines (Jan 2012) state the following:
"For the purposes of PMHC, children are defined as being 11 years of age or under (or up to and including 15 years of age in exceptional circumstances where clinically needed and appropriate)."

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Where can I obtain a episode form?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Generally speaking, GP episode forms have been created by the individual Primary Health Networks (they must align to the MDS fields).

There is a sample template at the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing website, which you can use :

http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/mental-ba-gpsamp

Alternatively, if you use a search engine to search for mental health care plan (or Item 2710) episode templates, many Primary Health Networks have the forms they are using available on the web for you to browse.

------------
Service contact data
------------














^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
How do I view reports on before and after scores (of outcome measures)?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is no automatic report that generates this data for you. However, you can easily access this data for your Primary Health Network via the 'Download' data feature in the MDS.

#. Click on the 'File Transfers' link in the right hand menu in the MDS.
#. In the 'File Downloads' section, select the date range you wish to download.
#. Select 'Episodes' for Type.
#. Click on the 'Include measures' box just under the Type. (if you don't click on this the measures won't be included in the download)
#. Click on download then save the file to your drive.

This will produce a .csv file which you can then view and sort through either via MS Excel or another spreadsheet or database.

.. _Uploading-data-from-other-databases:
-----------------------------------
Uploading data from other databases
-----------------------------------

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Uploading data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Read the Upload Checklist for a quick guide to uploading your data in bulk to the MDS. Full details regarding UPLOADS can be found on the MDS ONLINE HELP.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
How do I obtain a template to upload my data to the MDS?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The upgrade released in December 2010 introduced additional fields to the MDS. This affects the format in which your data can be uploaded. You can create your own template to obtain the exact format and column headings required for a successful upload to the MDS by undertaking the following:

#. Enter dummy/test data manually in the MDS using the online form. You will need to enter complete data for the client, episode and service contacts sections, as well as outcome measures. Ensure you enter enough data to cover every ‘Episode type’ option relevant to your Primary Health Network. (The ‘Episode type’ options reflect the different program types available under both Tier 1 and 2. Therefore, if your Primary Health Network participates in every program, you will need to enter seven dummy/test records, in order to cover all seven episode type options. (The MDS will generate different fields, according to which ‘Episode type’ option you select. Therefore, by creating a separate record for every episode type, you will ensure every field is covered.)
#. Once you have entered enough dummy/test data to reflect every ‘Episode type’ option and ‘Outcome measures’ relevant to your Primary Health Network, you can now ‘Download’ your data to produce a csv file for ‘client’, ‘episode’ and ‘service contacts’ data. (Please refer to :ref:`'How-do-I-download-my-data-from-the-MDS'` for instructions on downloading your data from the MDS).
#. The files produced from your download are the exact format and sequence required for uploading your data. Therefore, you can copy the column headings into a blank spreadsheet to create your upload template. You can also use the data content of your download files to understand the data types accepted for each data field. More information on data uploads is available on the MDS Online Help.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I have already collected a large amount of data and entered it into another database (e.g., Excel, Access), how can I transfer these data to the minimum dataset?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is important that all Primary Health Network running PMHC use the minimum dataset in order to provide a national picture of who is accessing PMHC services and what services are being provided. If you find that entering all of the data into the minimum dataset is too burdensome, you are able to utilise a portion of your evaluation funds to pay someone to do the data entry. Please note that you will need to provide this person with some brief training in how to use the minimum dataset. There is some functionality for Data Upload if your Primary Health Network has an alternative means of collecting and storing the minimum dataset data, for example Excel or Access. Information on this procedure can be found at :ref:`'Uploading-data-from-other-databases'`.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
What do I do if I have collected the data in Excel or Access?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See the online MDS documentation regarding uploads. Note that the data upload method of submitting data exposes you to more risk of data loss since it relies on the user to be aware of more issues with the data submission process. This feature is best used where a software/database developer is engaged to extract data from an existing system, converting it into a format suitable for upload. If you don't already have a satisfactory system that can be modified to export the required upload files, consider using the online data entry interface thoroughly before making your decision. You can ask further questions about the process by emailing support@pmhc-mds.com.

A detailed document for data uploads is available on our website, see Upload File Format.

-------------------------
Capturing additional data
-------------------------

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It seems that the data being collected is quite limited, would it not be useful to collect more detailed information?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The development of the minimum dataset balanced the ideal against what was realistic, given that any additional data item places extra burden on those collecting and entering data.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
What are the options where the information collected does not fit into the available fields?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The options here are to select the closest available category. Where it is available, "other" should be selected if the response does not fit any of the categories provided, for example, ICD-10 diagnostic categories.

---------------------------
Data reporting and analysis
---------------------------

Are Primary Health Networks required to conduct any analyses of the data entered in the minimum dataset?
Primary Health Networks are not required to conduct any analyses of minimum dataset data for the purposes of the national evaluation, but may wish to do so as part of their local evaluations.

=============
Checking data
=============

Each individual Primary Health Network is responsible for checking their data in the MDS to confirm its accuracy and completion. It is advisable that this review is undertaken regularly to ensure data integrity and avoid widespread errors.

A high level review can be undertaken using the automated reports available in the 'Report selection' section of the MDS.

Alternatively, for greater precision and to access your data in full, you can download your data. More information on using the automated reports and downloading your data.

================
Downloading data
================

.. _How-do-I-download-my-data-from-the-MDS:
------------------------------------
How do I download data from the MDS?
------------------------------------

There are two ways you can extract your data from the MDS:

#. via the 'File transfers' feature, and
#. By using the automated reports in the ‘Report selection’ section of the MDS.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Download using 'File transfers' feature:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This feature enables you to select your data by date range and by type of data (e.g., ‘client’, ‘episode’ or ‘service contact’). Once selected you can then download your data to your computer and import it into your preferred program to undertake your analysis. There are many programs which you can use to do your analysis, and these include (but are not limited to) Excel, Access, SPSS, etc.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
How to download data from the MDS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. From within the MDS click on the 'File Transfers' link located on the top right hand side of the screen
#. The 'Date' section allows you to select a specific financial year period by clicking on the scroll down menu and selecting your required date range.
#. The 'Type' section allows you to specify one of 'client', 'episode' or 'service contacts' data to download. (If you select ‘episode’ data, then you have the option to 'include measures', being the associated outcome measure data.)
#. Click on the 'Download' button to download your data and save this as a .csv file to your pc.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Automated Reports available in the MDS:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These can be accessed via the main screen in the MDS, located within the 'Report selection' link.

**Episode type cross-tabulation.**  This provides a breakdown of episode types (programs) by date period and by the following items: service contact type, copayment amount, low income, education, lives alone, previous care, modality and service contact duration.

**Data Summary.** This provides a breakdown of client and service contact numbers tabulated by financial year and number of service contacts. Please note: Service contacts are linked with Episode dates, and therefore will appear in the financial year in which the associated episode took place. More information on the MDS User Guide/Reports.

**Frequency Distribution.** This provides basic frequency data (count and percentage) for various items collected. More information on the MDS User Guide/Reports.

------------------------------------------------
How do I view before/after outcome measure data?
------------------------------------------------

This information is located in the 'Episodes' data files, therefore you will need to download this data to view the before and after outcome measures. You can download this data by following these steps:

#. From within the MDS click on the 'File Transfers' link located on the top right hand side of the screen
#. The 'Date' section allows you to select a specific financial year period by clicking on the scroll down menu and selecting your required date range.
#. The 'Type' section allows you to specify one of 'client', 'episode' or 'service contacts' data to download. Select ‘episode’ data and check the 'include measures' box to include the associated outcome measure data in your download.
#. Click on the 'Download' button to download your data and save this as a .csv file to your pc.

This will download your data for the period you wish to view and it will include the before/after measures (which is attached to the episode).

---------------------------------------------------------------
How do I report on 'episode types' during this financial year?
---------------------------------------------------------------

There is no automated report that will produce these figures for you, so you would need to this manually by downloading your Primary Health Networks episode data from the MDS.

Instructions:

#. Click on the 'File Transfers' link in the MDS.
#. Select the date range required.
#. Select 'Episodes' for 'Type'.
#. Click on the 'Download' button.

This process will download your Primary Health Networks 'episode' data in a .csv format. This format is readily acceptable by most data/analysis tools such as Excel, Access, SPSS, etc. Save this file and then import/open it using your preferred data/analysis tool (e.g., Excel, Access, SPSS, etc).

Look at the 'episode_type' column to identify the various episode type programs. You can sort/filter, etc., to count each of these types.

-------------------------------------------
How do I report on 'episodes by postcode'?
-------------------------------------------

In order to obtain a csv file containing all of the episode fields, including the client and referrer postcodes, you will need to download your Primary Health Networks episode data from the MDS.

Instructions:

#. Click on the 'File Transfers' which is on the right hand side menu when you login.
#. Select the date range required.
#. Select 'Episodes' for 'Type'.
#. Click on the 'Download' button.

======================================
Accessing data in the minimum data set
======================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are Primary Health Networks able to access the minimum dataset at any time? Is it possible to get back information for our own records using the Minimum Dataset, if so how do we go about doing that?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Primary Health Networks are able to access their minimum dataset data at any time even after entering information. Be sure that you keep a record of Client Keys (unique identifiers) so that you can look up specific client information already entered into the minimum dataset. There are links client.csv, service_contact.csv and datadict.csv in the data download section of the Main Page. It extracts only your own Primary Health Network's information. This can be imported into other programs (e.g., Excel, SPSS) and you can manipulate the data for your internal use.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do Primary Health Networks have access to all of the data that is entered into the minimum dataset?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each Primary Health Network can only view data that has been entered by that Primary Health Network, not all data entered by .

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can more than one staff member at the Primary Health Network access the minimum dataset?

More than one staff member at the Primary Health Network can view the minimum dataset at the same time; however, you should take care not to enter data about the same client at the same time.

There are two levels of access provided. Please refer to :ref:`'How-do-I-obtain-access-to-the-MDS?'` for a description of the levels of access, and how to obtain each level of access.

Storing data relating to the minimum dataset system
===================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After entering data in the MDS how long should I store my hardcopy and/or electronic files?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no set time limit; however, it is recommend that you archive this data and keep it secure for at least two years. As with all electronic data (including MDS) there is a risk of corruption - whether it is due to a system bug or human error. Therefore, it is always good to have the original data as a backup to either check details against or re-enter, if needed.

==================
PMHC mailing list
==================

-----------------------------------------------
How can I be advised of any changes to the MDS?
-----------------------------------------------

When changes are made to the MDS we alert all users via an email list. MDS users are automatically added to this list, however sometimes other Primary Health Network staff who do not have accounts wish to be informed of updates. If you would like to be added to the mailing list please email support@pmhc-mds.com.

------------------------------------------------------
I have an MDS account but don't receive update emails.
------------------------------------------------------

Please check that we have your correct email address. After logging into the MDS, click the 'Edit my details' link on the right hand side and verify you email address.

Mailing list emails will be sent from support@pmhc-mds.com. Please make sure this is not being caught in any spam filters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I no longer wish to receive PMHC update emails. How can I be removed from the list?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please email support@pmhc-mds.com and ask to be removed from the mailing list.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am a third-party software developer developing code to assist with uploading data to the MDS. Can I be informed of updates to the MDS?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, we have a mailing list specifically for third-party developers. Please email support@pmhc-mds.com and ask to be added to the developers mailing list. Please provide us with a generic address that will survive staffing changes.
