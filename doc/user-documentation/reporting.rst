Reporting
=========

A comprehensive Reporting feature is due to be fully integrated into the PMHC MDS
in Stage Two of the PMHC MDS development, currently scheduled for mid 2017.

We plan to release some basic reporting features prior to the implementation of
Departmental Reports.  An update will be circulated to all current users and the mailing list
when new reports are added.

Once this feature is available, you will only be able to see the Reporting tab if
you have been assigned the 'Reporting' role.

In the interim, PMHC MDS users with the reporting role can access their
organisation's current PMHC MDS data through the Data Extraction tab - see :ref:`data_extraction`.
