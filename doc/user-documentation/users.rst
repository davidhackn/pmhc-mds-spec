Users
=====

You will only be able to see the Users tab if you have been assigned
the 'User Management' role.

If you donâ€™t have access to the Users tab and you believe you should, please
contact someone in your provider organisation or provider organisation's PHN
who has the 'User Management' role.

If you are unsure who has the 'User Management' role please email the
PMHC Helpdesk at support@pmhc-mds.com

After navigating to the Users tab, you will be presented with a list of the
users that are assigned to the organisations for which you have the
'User Management' role.

Users Roles
^^^^^^^^^^^

Access to the PMHC MDS is based around roles. The following table provides a summary of each of
the roles that currently exist within the PMHC MDS:

+----------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Role**                   | **Tasks allowed**                                                                                                                  |
+============================+====================================================================================================================================+
| Organisation Management    | A user with the Organisation Management role for a PHN can manage provider organisations for that PHN                              |

| User Management            | A user with the User Management role for an organisation can manage user accounts for that organisation                            |

Each role allows a user to perform specific tasks. A user can have more than one role.
Each role is granted for a user against an organisation. An organisation can
either be a Primary Health Network or a provider organisation. If a user is granted
a role for a Primary Health Network (PHN) they will also have this role for any
provider organisation's of that PHN. A user can be invited to have a role at more
than one organisations.

What users see once they are logged in will depend upon what roles they have been
assigned. The table below lists the tabs that will be shown for each role:

+-------------------------+---------------------------+
| Role                    | Tab                       |
+=========================+===========================+
| Organisation Management | Organisations             |
+-------------------------+---------------------------+
| User Management         | Organisations, Users      |
+-------------------------+---------------------------+
| Upload                  | Upload                    |

Adding a user

Note: PHNs can devolve user management authority to one or more users in a

logins, or a PHN can choose to keep user management authority at the level of
the PHN requiring each provider organisation to contact the PHN when they need
a new user added.

PMHC MDS.  You can invite a new user through the Users tab, by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the Users tab.
