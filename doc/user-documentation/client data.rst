Client Data
===========

You will only be able to see the Client Data tab if you have been assigned
the 'Data Entry' :ref:`roles`.

If you donâ€™t have access to the Client Data tab and you believe you should, please
contact someone in your provider organisation or provider organisation's PHN
who has the 'User Management' role. If you are unsure who has the 'User Management'
role please email the PMHC Helpdesk at support@pmhc-mds.com

After navigating to the Client Data tab, you will be presented with three search boxes
which will allow you to easily find and view the client data for the organisations
you have permission to access.
