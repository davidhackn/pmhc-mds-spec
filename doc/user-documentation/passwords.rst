Passwords
=========

As required by the Australian Government's Protective Security Policy Framework
passwords have to be changed every 3 months. If you do not change your password
it will expire and you will not be able to login to the system without resetting
your password.

Passwords are to be:

* 13 or more characters with no complexity requirements, or
* a minimum of 10 characters with at least 3 of the following character sets

  - lowercase characters (a-z)
  - uppercase characters (A-Z)
  - digits (0-9)
  - punctuation and special characters

* changed at least every 90 days
* changed by users no more than once a day
* not reused from any of the preceding eight changes

Please note: Users will be reminded via an email sent from noreply@strategicdata.com.au
14 days prior to when their password is due to expire, and on PMHC MDS login 7 days prior
to the password expiry.

If a password expires the user will not be able to access the PMHC MDS until they
reset their password - see :ref:`forgotten-password`.
