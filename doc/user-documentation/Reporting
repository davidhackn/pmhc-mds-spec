Reporting
=========

A comprehensive Reporting feature is dues to be fully integrated into the PMHC MDS
in Stage Two of the PMHC MDS development, currently scheduled for mid 2017.

We hope to release some basic reporting features prior to the implementation of
Stage Two.  An update will be circulated to all current user and the mailing list
as soon as this feature has been released.

Once this feature is released, you will only be able to see the Reporting tab if
you have been assigned the 'Reporting' role.

In the interim, PMHC MDS users with the reporting role can access their
organisation's current PMHC MDS data through the Data Extraction tab - see :ref:`data_extraction`.
