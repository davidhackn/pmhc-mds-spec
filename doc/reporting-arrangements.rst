Reporting arrangements
======================

.. _reporting_data:

Reporting data
-------------
PHNs and their service providers are able to either export data from their client
systems and upload to the PMHC MDS or enter data manually via the data entry interface.

The system is able to accept data for any period in which the provider organisation
is active, either in its entirety or partially. Please note the section below regarding timeliness.

Accepting data for any period allows organisations to upload corrections when
erroneous data has been identified. Allowing partial uploads allows for
submission of data by separate providers without the need for the PHN to
aggregate all data prior to upload.

Where associated unique keys match (e.g. Patient Key or Episode Key)
these records will be replaced, if the key is new, a new record will be created.

Data may be uploaded in either Excel or CSV format.

.. _reporting_timeliness:

Reporting timeliness
--------------------

Records must be reported to the MDS within 31 days of the activity which
generated them. For example if a client was added to the system on the 12th of
November 2016 their client record must be added to the MDS on or before the
13th of December 2016. Similarly, if a service contact occurred on that date,
the data associated with that contact must be submitted to the MDS by 13th of
December 2016 also.

The Department accesses information within the MDS for internal planning and
governance purposes therefore data in the MDS needs to be current to ensure the
accuracy of the data produced for the Department.

Support arrangements
--------------------
Support is available to PHNs and
their third party developers to assist with implementing upload facilities
in existing client management systems. For those PHNs who do not upload via
a client management system, documentation and support is available to manually
enter data via a web data entry interface.
