Reporting arrangements
======================

During the initial stage of implementing the PMHC MDS, PHNs and their service providers will be able to either export data from their client systems and upload to the PMHC MDS or manually create spreadsheets that can then be uploaded. 

Data will be uploaded in either Excel or CSV format and an upload specification will be provided to PHNs by August 2016. Support will be available to PHNs to assist with uploads. Documentation and support will be available to those PHNs who need to manually create spreadsheets.

PMHC MDS upload functionality will be separate from the existing ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS. During this initial stage the existing ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS will be kept operational so that ATAPS/MHSRRA organisations can continue to provide data through that system until they are either ready to export data to the new upload interface or until the new data entry interface is available after a later stage of development. Once all ATAPS/MHSRRA organisations are submitting data to the PMHC MDS the ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS will be shut down. Data for programs other than ATAPS/MHSRRA will have to be submitted via the PMHC MDS interface.
